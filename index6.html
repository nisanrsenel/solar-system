                    <div class="left">
                        <p><br>Mercury—the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than 
                            Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters.
                            Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system.
                            But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

                    <h4 class="underline" id="venus" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">VENUS</h4>
                    <div class="right">
                        <img src="images/Spinning_Venus.gif" alt="Venus" width="400" height="400"/>
                        <p><br>Although Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun, it is the hottest planet. This is because 
                            it has an atmosphere containing intense greenhouse gases. Venus is a very active planet, with mountains 
                            and volcanoes on its surface. The dimensions of Venus are very close to the Earth. An important feature 
                            that distinguishes Venus from other planets is that it rotates around itself in the opposite direction 
                            of the Earth and many other planets. Therefore, the sun rises from the west, sets from the east.

                    <h4 class="underline" id="earth" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">EARTH</h4>
                    <div class="left">
                        <p><br>The Earth has a solid crust, a surface that includes active volcanoes, mountains, valleys, canyons, 
                            plains and many other landforms. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. About 70% of its surface 
                            is made up of oceans and seas. Its atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and contains a lot of oxygen for 
                            us to breathe. In addition, its atmosphere protects us from meteorites, meteors entering our atmosphere 
                            disintegrate and then reach the earth's surface.

                    <h4 class="underline" id="mars" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">MARS</h4>

                        <img src="images/DPvp.gif" alt="Mars" width="400" height="400"/>
                        <p><br>Mars is a cold desert planet that is half the size of Earth. It looks red because of the iron in its 
                            soil. For this reason, it is also called the ”Red Planet". Like Earth, Mars has seasons, poles, volcanoes, 
                            canyons and weather events. The atmosphere is very thin. It consists of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon.
                            Currently, water exists on Mars only in sparse clouds and icy soil. A day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours.

                    <h4 class="underline" id="jupiter" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">JUPITER</h4>
                    <div class="left">
                        <p><br>Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System. Its atmosphere is covered with swirling cloud streaks.
                            In the place called the ”Great Red Spot", there are storms that have been going on for hundreds of years. 
                            Jupiter is a gas giant, so it does not have a solid surface. It is thought that there is an Earth-sized 
                            solid core at its center. Jupiter also has rings, but they are too pale to be seen by the eye.
                        </p>

                    <h4 class="underline" id="saturn" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">SATURN</h4>
                    <div class="right">
                        <img src="images/vO04Ex.gif" alt="Saturn" width="400" height="400"/>
                        <p><br>Saturn is a gas giant just like Jupiter and consists mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has an intense 
                            atmosphere. Saturn is famous because of its rings. This ringed planet has 7 rings with gaps between them.
                            These rings are made up of pieces of ice and rock.
                        </p>

                    <h4 class="underline" id="uranus" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">URANUS</h4>
                    <div class="left">
                        <p><br>Uranus consists of water, methane and ammonia liquids above its small rocky center. Its atmosphere is 
                            composed of hydrogen and helium, as on Jupiter and Saturn. It also contains methane. The substance that 
                            gives Uranus its blue color is methane. Uranus has also pale rings. Uranus, an ice giant, is the only 
                            planet that rotates sideways. And it also turns from east to west.
                        </p>

                    <h4 class="underline" id="neptune" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;">NEPTUNE</h4>
                    <div class="right">
                        <img src="images/Neptune.gif" alt="Neptune" width="400" height="400"/>
                        <p><br>Neptune, the last planet in our Solar System, is dark, cold and very windy. Neptune, an ice giant like 
                            Uranus, consists of dense water vapor, ammonia and methane gas on top of a solid center that is the same 
                            size as the Earth. Its atmosphere consists of hydrogen, helium and methane. Just like Uranus, it is methane 
                            that gives Neptune its blue color. Neptune has 6 rings, but they are very difficult to see.
