                <h1><b>THE SOLAR SYSTEM’S MOST STUNNING RINGED PLANET | SATURN</b></h1>
                <p><i>An overview of the history of Saturn, the ringed planet.</i></p>
                <p>Saturn, also known as the ringed planet, is best known for its distinct ring system. These rings have fascinated 
                stargazers for centuries. Although through binoculars or a small telescope the ringed planet appears surrounded 
                by a single solid ring, it actually has seven large separate rings that are separated by dark divisions. Other 
                fainter rings have been discovered as telescope technology has improved.</p>
                <h4>WHAT ARE SATURN’S RINGS MADE OF?</h4>
                <p>The rings are about 170,000 miles across and are actually made up of billions of particles, ranging from the size of 
                a grain of sand to the size of a building that is a couple stories high. Some are even as tall as mountains. Composed 
                predominately of water ice, the rings also draw in rocky meteoroids as they travel through space. They would look mostly 
                white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of the ringed planet.  Each ring also orbits at a different speed around 
                the planet. The ice particles fall into a ring shape because each one follows a similar orbital path. The rings themselves 
                contain a number of gaps and structures. Some are created by Saturn’s many small moons, while others continue to puzzle 
                astronomers.</p>
                <h4>WHEN WAS THE RINGED PLANET DISCOVERED?</h4>
                <p>When Galileo Galilei first observed Saturn in 1610, he thought that the rings were enormous moons. One positioned on 
                each side of the planet. Over several years he noted that the rings changed shape and even disappeared. We know now that 
                Galileo was observing a ring plane crossing, which occurs because Saturn’s equator and its rings are tilted relative to 
                its orbit. As it circles the Sun, the orientation of the equator and rings appears to change, which causes us to sometimes 
                see the rings edge on. This makes it look like they disappear.</p>
                <h4>CASSINI-HUYGENS</h4>
                <p>In 2004, NASA and the ESA’s Cassini-Huygens mission became the first to enter orbit around the ringed planet, taking 
                detailed observations not only of the planet, but also of its ring system. Cassini directly measured the mass of the 
                rings via the gravitational effects as the spacecraft passed between the rings of Saturn and its cloud tops. It found 
                that the ring are about half as massive as Earth’s Antarctic ice shelf, with the mass spread across a surface area that 
                is 80 times larger than Earth.</p>
