                <p><br><br>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and 
                    heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this energy is emitted from its surface 
                    as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.

                    <br><br>About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of
                    hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and 
                    energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational 
                    pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the 
                    hydrogen and helium remained in the center of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to 
                    begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system.</p>

        <div class="secondp">
            <p>Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, 
                and other bodies in our solar system.
            
            <br><br>The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest 
            particles of debris – in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean 
            currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our 
            Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.
            
            <br><br>Sun has been a central subject for astronomical research since ancient times.<br><br><br><br></p>
